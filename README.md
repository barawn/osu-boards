# OSU Board Repository

This is a simple repository for OSU boards. This needs to be
converted into one that can be used with the "Board Manager"
still, so for *now*, just:

1: Create a "hardware" directory under the Arduino directory
2: Check this repository out into an "osu-boards" directory there.

This should cause a category labelled "OSU (in sketchbook)" to appear
in Tools->Boards.
